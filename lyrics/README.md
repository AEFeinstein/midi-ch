# MusicXML Lyrics To Clone Hero

## How to use
Select a MusicXML file (`.xml`, `.mxl`, or `.musicxml`). The Lyrics will be extracted, and you will be given back some code that goes into the `[Events]` part of your  `chart` file.

This works best when the rest of the chart was generated with MIDI-CH already using a MIDI file that's synonymous with the MusicXML file, the reason for MusicXML is MIDI doesn't store lyrics information.

## When a .mxl file doesn't work
Music XML Files are often stored as .zip files; if a MusicXML file doesn't work, try changing the extension to .zip, extracting the files and importing just the .xml file inside the extracted folder.
